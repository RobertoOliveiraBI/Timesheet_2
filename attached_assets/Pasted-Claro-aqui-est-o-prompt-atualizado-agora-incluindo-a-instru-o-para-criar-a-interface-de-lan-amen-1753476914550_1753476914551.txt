Claro, aqui está o prompt atualizado, agora incluindo a instrução para criar a interface de lançamento semanal de horas no formato de planilha, com dias de segunda a sábado:

**Prompt para o agente Replit (em inglês):**

Hello, we need to **rebuild the entire timesheet hour entry module** from scratch. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to configure the select fields for clients, campaigns, and tasks, we’ve decided to change the approach entirely.

⚠️ **Important:**
**Do not make changes to any other part of the system** — only work on the hour entry section (the timesheet input). Leave all other modules untouched.

Please **respond in Portuguese**, as I will validate and test everything in that language.

### 1. User Flow

* The user selects a **client**
* Based on the client, the system loads **related campaigns**
* Based on the campaign, the system loads **related tasks**
* The user inputs:

  * Number of hours worked
  * Date of the task
* The entry is submitted for manager review

### 2. New Requirement: Weekly Timesheet Format

* Instead of daily entries, we want a **weekly input view**
* Display a table (like a spreadsheet) with **columns from Monday to Saturday**
* Each **row represents one task** (selected by the user)
* The user will fill in the number of hours worked on each day for that task
* The table should allow:

  * Selecting client, campaign, and task for each row
  * Inputting hours from Monday to Saturday
  * Adding or removing rows dynamically
* At the bottom, calculate the total of hours per day and per row

### 3. Technical Requirements

* **Do not reuse the broken dropdown logic**
* Use a **more stable and dynamic method**, with:

  * Server-side or async loading of options
  * Proper validation and error handling
  * Smart dependencies (campaigns should load only after client selection, etc.)

### 4. Database Considerations

Make sure each entry stores:

* user ID
* client ID
* campaign ID
* task ID
* day of the week
* date
* number of hours

---

### 5. UX Expectation

* Prioritize **usability and stability**
* The weekly table should be easy to navigate and quick to fill
* It must validate before submission and support error feedback
